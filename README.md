# CONCEPT Login System

A simple login system made in C++ with the help of the most popular JSON library (Nlohmann).

## Compiling

You need to have *make* installed in order to compile it.
After that, just run the command in the main directory and you should be good to go.

```bash
make
```

## Running

Run the executable file that it creates after *make*.

```bash
.\loginsystem.exe
```

After that, it is pretty easy and straightforward what you need to do.

## Known bugs

* If it doesn't have a file 'db.json' in the same directory as the program, it will not work.

## Warnings ❗❗❗

This program is not made to be used as a realistic login system in big projects. This is just a concept and it is made for educational purposes only.
